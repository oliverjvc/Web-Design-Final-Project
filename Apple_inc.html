            <p style="margin: 20px 30px;">Apple was founded as <b>Apple Computer Company</b> on April 1, 1976, by <b>Steve Jobs</b>, <b>Steve Wozniak</b> and <b>Ronald Wayne</b> to develop and sell Wozniak's <i>Apple I</i> personal computer. It was incorporated by <b>Jobs</b> and <b>Wozniak</b> as <b>Apple Computer</b>, Inc. in 1977 and the company's next computer, the <em>Apple II</em> became a best seller. Apple went public in 1980, to instant financial success. The company went onto develop new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the original Macintosh, announced in a critically acclaimed advertisement, "<i>1984</i>", directed by <b>Ridley Scott</b>. By 1985, the high cost of its products and power struggles between executives caused problems. <b>Wozniak</b> stepped back from <b>Apple</b> amicably, while <b>Jobs</b> resigned to found <b>NeXT</b>, taking some <b>Apple</b> employees with him.</p>
